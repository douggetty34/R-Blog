Iâ€™m a PhD student at the University of Pittsburgh in the Cognitive Psychology program. My research interests include language processing, processing variablity in speech, and syntactic priming. I am also interested in data analysis methods. In my free time I enjoy rock climbing, biking, and any other activity where I can be outside.
