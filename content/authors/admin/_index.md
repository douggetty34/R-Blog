Iâ€™m a PhD student at the University of Pittsburgh in the Cognitive Psychology program. My research interests include language processing, how humans handle variablity in speech, and quantitative methods. In my free time I like to climb rocks, attend angsty concerts, and ride my bike around Pittsburgh.
